# Tritium Launcher

This will eventually become a Minecraft Launcher built for Modpack Developers styled as an IDE, implementing features such as:
* Modpack version uploads to sites such as Curseforge or Modrinth
* Easy Mod config file modification
* Console for viewing or uploading Logs, along with proper text theming
* Git integration
* Mod integrations
* Plugin support (Themes, UI functionality, Mod integration, etc)
* Eventually, more.

The launcher is currently very incomplete, currently not capable of creating Instances or launching them. I'll make a roadmap sometime.
